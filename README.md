# arduino-esp8266-atcmd
Library for Arduino UNO talking to an ESP8266 Wi-Fi board (e.g., Adafruit Huzzah) via AT command sets 

# Hardware Setup

Note this library is for Arduino UNO board (or similar Arduino boards) 
to talk a ESP8266 wifi breakout board via AT command set over UART.  
This is NOT a wifi library for running Arduino natively on the ESP8266 board.

In the following example, we will assume Arduino UNO board and connecting with Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 wifi breakout board.

Below is a typical setup: (TODO)

* Connect esp8266 ground to Arduino ground
* Connect esp8266 V+ to 5V on Arduino board
* Connect esp8266 RX/TX pins to any two digital pins on Arduino except 0,1

# Flashing ESP8266 AT firmware

(TODO)
